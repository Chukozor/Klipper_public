# #   Damping ratios of vibrations of X and Y axes used by input shapers
# #   to improve vibration suppression. Default value is 0.1 which is a
# #   good all-round value for most printers. In most circumstances this
# #   parameter requires no tuning and should not be changed.
# # At this point, it suffices to know that after a Klipper restart, these changes will take immediate effect and Input Shaping will be enabled. Itâ€™s also important to keep in mind that these settings may need to be revisited if any significant physical changes are made to the printer, including changing belt tension.
