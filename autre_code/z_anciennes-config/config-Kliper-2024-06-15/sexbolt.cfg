To write a macro that uses the sexbolt to determine the right z-offset when switching nozzles, you can use the following code as a starting point:
This macro assumes that you have a bed mesh and a probe defined in your configuration file, and that you have a filament sensor with a sexbolt located at a specific X, Y, and Z position. The macro first moves the print head to the center of the bed, probes the bed to get the current Z value, and then determines which nozzle is currently active based on the filament sensor. It then moves the print head to the sexbolt and uses the sexbolt to adjust the Z offset for the current nozzle. Finally, it moves the print head back to the center of the bed.

You can customize the macro by adjusting the starting Z offsets for each nozzle, and by modifying the G-code commands that move the print head and adjust the Z offset.
